## Horiseo Challenge #1
- My motivation for building this was to see how much I could play with this project for class.
- I wanted to make some crazy changes, but I stood with simplicity and just simplified some fonts and classes
- This website now works properly and is a steady example of usage of html and css.
- I learned that each px difference wont work properly when rescaling browser without "flex-wrap" type code.


## Usage
User can use links at the top of the page to scroll to sections now after defactoring.
